# Pixel North website

A single-page website for Pixel North: *Small business sites, sorted.*

It is plain HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript in one file, with no build step and no dependencies. The only external request is Google Fonts (Outfit and DM Sans).

## Files

- `index.html`: the main page
- `privacy.html`, `cookies.html`: the privacy notice and cookie policy
- `404.html`: the branded "page not found" page
- `free-website-terms.html`: terms for the launch free-website prize draw (hidden from search engines)
- Contact form: submissions are sent through Forminit. The form ID is `FORM_ID` in the script at the bottom of `index.html`.
- `consent.js`: the cookie banner and settings; it loads Google Analytics only after consent. `GA_ID` at the top is the GA4 measurement ID (starts with `G-`)
- `chat-widget.js`: the "Ask Pixel" chat window, loaded by a script tag at the bottom of each page. Remove that tag to switch the chat off.
- `worker/pixel-north-worker.js`: the server side of the chat. It answers `/api/chat` using Cloudflare Workers AI, reads the site's own pages for its notes, and serves everything else as normal.
- `wrangler.jsonc`: Cloudflare settings (Worker name, AI connection, 404 page, log settings). The name must match the Worker in the Cloudflare dashboard.
- `.assetsignore`: keeps the config and Worker code out of the public website
- `sitemap.xml`: lists the pages for search engines
- `images/james.jpg`: the portrait in the hero section
- `images/og-image.png`: the preview image shown when the site is shared (1200 x 630)

## Things to check now and then

1. **The chat model.** Cloudflare retires AI models from time to time. If Pixel starts saying "I can't answer right now", check the model names at the top of `worker/pixel-north-worker.js` against developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models.
2. **The statistics.** The "Why your business needs a modern website" section quotes Ofcom, DataReportal and Squarespace/YouGov figures. Re-check them when you update the page.
3. **The privacy notice.** Keep it in step with any change to the form service, analytics, hosting or chat.

## Deploy with Cloudflare

The site is a Cloudflare Worker with static assets, connected to this GitHub repository.

1. Push to `main`: `git add .`, `git commit -m "message"`, `git push`.
2. Cloudflare builds automatically (`npx wrangler deploy`). Check progress under Workers & Pages, then Deployments.
3. Hard refresh the live site (Cmd+Shift+R) to see the change.

Do not add a folder called `functions`. Cloudflare reads that as a Pages project and the build fails.

## Brand reference

- The colours are CSS variables at the top of the `<style>` block, and the page always uses its light colour scheme, whatever the visitor's device setting.
